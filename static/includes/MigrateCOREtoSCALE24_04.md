TrueNAS users wanting to migrate from 13.0-U6 (latest) or 13.3 to TrueNAS 24.10 or later can migrate to 24.10 and earlier using the UI, but must clean install if migrating to later releases.
Attempting to migrate directly to releases later than 24.10 fail and cannot be done.

Download a copy of the <file>iso</file> for the latest maintenance release of 24.10 or eaaarlier, then follow the migration instructions in this Getting Started section of the TrueNAS Documentation Hub to move from the FreeBSD-based version of TrueNAS to the Linux Debian-based version of TrueNAS.
